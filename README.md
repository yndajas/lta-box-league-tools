# LTA box leage tools

Running `index.js` in a browser console on a completed box league page
([example](https://competitions.lta.org.uk/box-ladder/41263ef5-da77-4645-8a92-7174bb7f3569/event/2/round/6))
will generate HTML for a summary table. It might take a second or two to print
to the console, so be patient. The summary will show the top two players in each
box as well as match completion numbers.

`index.html` contains a HTML template intended for a
[Clubspark](https://clubspark.lta.org.uk) site, including some CSS to make the
table spacing more appropriate.

**Note:** any changes to the HTML template for the LTA box league site could
break this without notice.
